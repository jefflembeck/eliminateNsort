eliminateNsort takes in two lists, L1 and L2, and it returns a sorted list that is the subset of L1 that does not intersect with L2.

The mathematical notation behind this would be:  Sort(L1 - (L1 && L2))  [where && is used instead of the sign for intersection].

The sorting style returns the list sorted from greatest to least.
